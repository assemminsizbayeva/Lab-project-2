  <p>The first paragraph introduces the topic. It provides context and sets the stage for the information that follows. A good introduction draws the reader in without overwhelming them with detail.</p>

  <p>The second paragraph develops the idea further. Here you can expand on the subject, provide examples, or explain why the topic is important. This is the place for depth and nuance.</p>

  <p>The third paragraph wraps things up. It summarizes the main points, reinforces the message, or suggests what the reader might do next. A clear conclusion leaves a lasting impression.</p>
